Launch from
   The :doc:`server <../settings/server>` to run the connection's command from. The server must be connected at the time the connection is launched, either manually or by using a :doc:`batch connection <connect-batch>`. It's also possible to launch the command as a child process of :program:`qtermy` itself.

Save connection as
   Check the box and specify a name to save the connection as. This may be required depending on how the dialog was launched. If not checked, the connection will be created as a one-time anonymous connection. Anonymous connections do appear in the :doc:`Manage Connections window <manage-connections>` but cannot be edited.
