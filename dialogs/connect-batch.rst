Batch Connection
================

A *batch connection* is a special type of :doc:`connection <../settings/connection>` that specifies a list of saved connections to run in sequence. This allows connections to be quickly and easily opened to multiple remote systems across multiple hops. A batch connection can even contain other batch connections.

The :ref:`nearby figure <connect-batch-example>` shows the Batch Connection dialog with an example batch connection. The batch connection contains three connections:

   * The :term:`persistent user server`
   * A :ref:`user connection <connect-user>` to the local root user
   * A :ref:`container connection <connect-container>` to a local container

Each of the latter two connections is run from the server made available by the previous connection in the list. In this way, a TermySequence connection to the container can be established in a single operation.

.. tip:: The connections in a batch connection are not required to depend on each other. In addition to opening connections across multiple hops, a batch connection can be used simply as a means to open many connections at once.

When :termy:action:`opening <OpenConnection>` a batch connection, each connection in the list will be opened in sequence using individual :doc:`tasks <../tools/tasks>`. Connections that are already established will be skipped. A :doc:`connection status dialog <connection-status>` will be shown for each connection to collect passwords if necessary. A :doc:`failed connection <../failed-to-connect>` will stop the sequence.
