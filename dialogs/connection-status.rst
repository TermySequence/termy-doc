Connection Status
=================

The Connection Status dialog is automatically shown when a :doc:`connection <../settings/connection>` is being :termy:action:`opened <OpenConnection>` and any of the following occur:

   * Output is printed by the connection's :termy:connection:`Command <Connection/Command>`.
   * A brief timeout has passed and the connection is still ongoing.
   * The connection has :doc:`failed <../failed-to-connect>`.

The dialog will automatically close when the connection succeeds.
