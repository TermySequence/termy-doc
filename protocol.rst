The TermySequence Protocol
==========================

The TermySequence Protocol defines the interface to the :doc:`termy-server <server>` multiplexer server. A design goal of the protocol is to make it as easy as possible to write new TermySequence clients. A :ref:`minimal client <strategy-minimal>` which only displays terminal screen contents can ignore most of the protocol entirely. Features such as :ref:`scrollback <strategy-scrollback>`, history, annotations, and file system support can be added to the client later if desired.

.. note:: This documentation is a work in progress. File an `issue <https://github.com/TermySequence/termy-doc/issues>`_ against termy-doc to request clarification or improvement if needed while developing a client.
