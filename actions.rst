Actions
=======

Actions are the mechanism by which :program:`qtermy`'s internal functions are invoked. All of :program:`qtermy`'s menu entries and all (non-literal) :ref:`key bindings <keymap-action>` are specified as action invocations. Actions can also be invoked in other ways:

  * As a result of mouse clicks in certain :doc:`tools/index`, whose actions can be configured via per-tool :doc:`global settings <settings/global>`.
  * By a :doc:`launcher <settings/launcher>` configured to treat its command's :termy:launcher:`output <InputOutput/OutputType>` as an action invocation.
  * By a triggered :doc:`alert <settings/alert>` configured to invoke an :termy:alert:`action <Parameters/Action>`.
  * By a :doc:`plugin <plugins/index>` implementing a :doc:`custom action <plugins/action>`, via :js:func:`manager.invoke`.
  * From the dialog box raised by the :termy:action:`Prompt` action.
  * From the command line on the local machine via the :doc:`qtermy-pipe <man/pipe>` utility.
  * From the :termy:action:`TipOfTheDay` window using special hyperlinks created by the :doc:`tip provider <plugins/totd>`.

An action invocation consists of an action name along with zero or more parameters, separated by vertical bar (\|) characters. This means that parameters themselves cannot contain the vertical bar (\|) character (there is no escaping mechanism). When invoking a :doc:`custom action <plugins/action>` registered by a :doc:`plugin <plugins/index>`, prepend the string "Custom" to the action's name.

Use the :ref:`genindex` to jump to an action's documentation if you know its name.

Conventions
-----------

Some action parameters have consistent behavior across many different actions.

.. _terminal-lookup:

Terminal Lookup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unless otherwise noted, the :termy:param:`TerminalId` action parameter has the following semantics:

  * If set to a UUID, the terminal with that identifier is used.
  * If unset, the :term:`active terminal` is used.

.. _server-lookup:

Server Lookup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unless otherwise noted, the :termy:param:`ServerId` action parameter has the following semantics:

  * If set to a UUID, the server with that :term:`identifier <server identifier>` is used.
  * If set to the string ``Local``, the :term:`local server` is used.
  * If unset, the :term:`active server` is used.

.. _job-lookup:

Job Lookup
^^^^^^^^^^

Unless otherwise noted, a combination of :termy:param:`RegionId` and :termy:param:`TerminalId` action parameters has the following semantics. Note that :doc:`shell integration <shell-integration>` is required for :term:`job regions <job>` to be created.

  * If both are empty, the :term:`current job` from the :term:`active viewport` is used.
  * If :termy:param:`RegionId` is the string ``Selected``, the :term:`selected job` in the active viewport is used.
  * If :termy:param:`RegionId` is the string ``Tool``, the selected job in the :doc:`History tool <tools/history>` will be used if that tool is :ref:`active <tools-active>`.
  * Otherwise, the terminal is looked up per :ref:`terminal-lookup` and :termy:param:`RegionId` is parsed as an unsigned decimal number and looked up within that terminal.

If the job lookup is successful, the region's terminal is made active in the active pane.

.. _task-lookup:

Task Lookup
^^^^^^^^^^^

Unless otherwise noted, the :termy:param:`TaskId` action parameter refers to a specific task UUID or to the selected task in the :doc:`Tasks tool <tools/tasks>` if empty.

.. _selection-handle-lookup:

Selection Handle Lookup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A text selection within a terminal viewport has two handles: upper and lower, one at each end of the selection. Certain actions modify the active text selection by adjusting one of the handles. These actions are intended to be run from :ref:`key bindings <keymap-action>` that are conditioned on :ref:`selection mode <keymap-modes>`. In these actions, the :termy:param:`Arg` action parameter used to choose a selection handle has the following semantics:

  * If :termy:param:`Arg` is ``1``, the upper handle is selected.
  * If :termy:param:`Arg` is ``2``, the lower handle is selected.
  * If :termy:param:`Arg` is ``0`` or empty, the currently selected handle is used. If no handle is selected, a default handle will be selected depending on the specific action.

The selected handle is drawn in a :ref:`different color <theme-editor-extended>` to distinguish it from the unselected handle.

.. termy:action:: ClearTerminalScrollback TerminalId

   Clears the scrollback buffer of the :ref:`specified terminal <terminal-lookup>`.

.. termy:action:: CloneTerminal Duplicate TerminalId

   Clones the :ref:`specified terminal <terminal-lookup>`, producing a new terminal on the same server. If :termy:param:`Duplicate` is ``1``, the scrollback buffer (including all regions) is duplicated in the new terminal. Otherwise, only the :doc:`profile settings <settings/profile>` and any settings overrides are copied and the new terminal starts empty.

.. termy:action:: CloseTerminal TerminalId

   Closes the :ref:`specified terminal <terminal-lookup>`. This may prompt for confirmation, depending on the value of the :termy:profile:`PromptClose <Emulator/PromptClose>` profile setting. If the terminal is :term:`hosting a connection <connection chaining>` to a server, the connection will be closed.

.. termy:action:: CloseWindow

   Closes the current application window. If there is only a single application window, equivalent to :termy:action:`QuitApplication`.

.. termy:action:: CommandTerminal ProfileName ServerId Cmdspec

   Creates a new terminal with :termy:param:`ServerId` and :termy:param:`ProfileName` specified as in :termy:action:`NewTerminal`. :termy:param:`Cmdspec` is an executable name and argument vector (including argument zero) separated by unit separator (``0x1f``) characters. The command specified by :termy:param:`Cmdspec` is run in the new terminal rather than the command specified in the :termy:profile:`Profile setting <Emulator/Command>`.

   This action is a specialization of :termy:action:`LaunchCommand`.

.. termy:action:: Copy TerminalId

   Copies the selected text in the :ref:`specified terminal <terminal-lookup>` to the clipboard. If there is no selected text, an empty string will be copied.

.. termy:action:: CopyFile Format ServerId RemotePath

   Initiates a task to copy the contents of the file named by the absolute path :termy:param:`RemotePath` on the :ref:`specified server <server-lookup>` to the clipboard. If :termy:param:`RemotePath` is empty, the selected file in the :doc:`Files tool <tools/files>` is used.

.. termy:action:: CopyFilePath FilePath

   If :termy:param:`FilePath` is empty, the path of the selected file in the :doc:`Files tool <tools/files>` is copied to the clipboard. Otherwise, :termy:param:`FilePath` is copied.

.. termy:action:: CopyImage Format TerminalId ContentId

   Initiates a task to copy the named content item in the :ref:`specified terminal <terminal-lookup>` to the clipboard. If :termy:param:`Format` is ``0``, the data is treated as UTF-8 text. If :termy:param:`Format` is ``1``, the data is treated as an image, parsed using `Qt5's QImage class <http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qimage.html#loadFromData>`_. If :termy:param:`Format` is empty, the data is treated as text if it's valid UTF-8 and as an image otherwise. Otherwise, :termy:param:`Format` is treated as a MIME type and the data is placed on the clipboard using that type.

   Content items are loaded into a terminal using the :doc:`termy-download <man/download>`, :doc:`termy-imgcat <man/download>`, or :doc:`termy-imgls <man/download>` utilities. Note that inline images may be reduced to thumbnails. To ensure that the original image data is downloaded, download the image file itself rather than the content item.

.. termy:action:: CopyJob RegionId TerminalId

   Copies the :ref:`specified job <job-lookup>`'s full text to the clipboard. If the job is not found, the clipboard is not touched.

.. termy:action:: CopyOutput RegionId TerminalId

.. termy:action:: CopyRegion RegionId TerminalId

   Looks up the specified region in the :ref:`specified terminal <terminal-lookup>` and copies its contents to the clipboard. Note that this is not a :ref:`job-lookup`. :termy:param:`RegionId` can refer to any region.

.. termy:action:: CopyScreen Format TerminalId

   Copies the contents of a viewport or terminal screen to the clipboard. If :termy:param:`TerminalId` is set, the contents of the specified terminal's screen are copied to the clipboard as text and :termy:param:`Format` is ignored. Otherwise, the contents of the :term:`active viewport` are copied as text if :termy:param:`Format` is empty, or as a PNG image if :termy:param:`Format` is ``png``.

.. termy:action:: CopySemantic RegionId TerminalId

   Looks up the specified :term:`semantic region` in the :ref:`specified terminal <terminal-lookup>` and copies its contents to the clipboard. Note that this is not a :ref:`job-lookup`. :termy:param:`RegionId` must refer to a region created by a :doc:`semantic parser <plugins/parser>`.

.. termy:action:: CopySuggestion Index

   If :termy:param:`Index` is empty, the selected suggestion in the :doc:`Suggestions tool <tools/suggestions>` is copied to the clipboard. Otherwise, the n\ :sup:`th` suggestion is copied, indexed from 0, specified by :termy:param:`Index`.

If :termy:param:`RemotePath` is empty, the selected file in the :doc:`Files tool <tools/files>` is used. A confirmation prompt may be shown, depending on the value of the :termy:global:`DeleteFileConfirmation <Files/DeleteFileConfirmation>` global setting and whether :termy:param:`RemotePath` is a file or directory. Non-empty directories *will* be recursively removed.

.. termy:action:: DisconnectServer ServerId

   Ends the connection to the :ref:`specified server <server-lookup>`.

.. termy:action:: DisconnectTerminal TerminalId

   If the :ref:`specified terminal <terminal-lookup>` terminal hosts a connection to a server, ends the connection.

.. termy:action:: DownloadFile ServerId RemotePath LocalPath

   Initiates a task to download the file named by the absolute path :termy:param:`RemotePath` on the :ref:`specified server <server-lookup>`. If :termy:param:`RemotePath` is empty, the selected file in the :doc:`Files tool <tools/files>` is used. The local destination :termy:param:`LocalPath` is interpreted as follows:

     * If set to the string ``<Prompt>``, a save file dialog will be shown.
     * If empty, the download folder specified by the :termy:server:`DownloadLocation <Files/DownloadLocation>` server setting or :termy:global:`DownloadLocation <Files/DownloadLocation>` global setting is used.
     * If set to an existing directory, the file will be saved to that directory.
     * If set to a path with a filename that does not exist, the file will be saved to that name.

   If the destination file already exists, the file may be saved under a different name, a confirmation prompt may be shown, or the task may fail, depending on the value of the :termy:global:`DownloadFileConfirmation <Files/DownloadFileConfirmation>` global setting.

   Downloads from :term:`local servers <local server>` are not allowed unless the :termy:global:`LocalDownloads <Server/LocalDownloads>` global setting is enabled.

.. termy:action:: DownloadImage TerminalId ContentId LocalPath

   Initiates a task to download the named content item in the :ref:`specified terminal <terminal-lookup>`. :termy:param:`LocalPath` is interpreted as in :termy:action:`DownloadFile`.

   Content items are loaded into a terminal using the :doc:`termy-download <man/download>`, :doc:`termy-imgcat <man/download>`, or :doc:`termy-imgls <man/download>` utilities. Note that inline images may be reduced to thumbnails. To ensure that the original image data is downloaded, download the image file itself rather than the content item.

   Markers may be substituted within the launcher's :termy:launcher:`command <Command/Command>` using the :termy:param:`Substitutions` parameter, which consists of zero or more strings of the form ``X=value`` separated by unit separator (``0x1f``) characters. ``X`` is the marker's letter and ``value`` is the string (treated as a single word) to substitute at the location of ``%X`` within the command.

   Depending on the configuration of the launcher and whether the server is :term:`local <local server>` or remote, any of the following may occur:

     * A desktop application may be launched as in :termy:action:`OpenDesktopUrl`.
     * A command may be run as in :termy:action:`RunCommand`.

   Refer to :doc:`settings/launcher` for more information on launchers.

.. termy:action:: LocalPortForward ServerId Spec

   Initiates a task to perform port forwarding between the application and the :ref:`specified server <server-lookup>`. The listening socket is on the local machine and outbound connections are made on the remote machine.

   :termy:param:`Spec` has the format :termy:param:`LocalSpec:RemoteSpec` with each part having the following format:

     * For TCP sockets: :termy:param:`0:Address:Port` or :termy:param:`0:[Address]:Port` if the address contains colon characters. For a listening socket bound to all addresses, use an empty address.
     * For Unix-domain sockets: :termy:param:`1:Path`. For listening sockets, the socket file will be created but its parent directory must exist and be writable.

   Port forwarding tasks can be launched on demand via the :doc:`Manage Port Forwarding window <dialogs/port-forwarding>` or automatically at server connection time via server :termy:server:`PortForwardingRules <Server/PortForwardingRules>`.

.. termy:action:: ManageAlerts

.. termy:action:: ManpageTerminal Manpage

   Opens a terminal on the :term:`local server` using the server's :termy:server:`default profile <Server/DefaultProfile>` and runs the command "man :termy:param:`Manpage`" rather than the command specified in the :termy:profile:`Profile setting <Emulator/Command>`.

   This action exists mostly to implement the "View Man Page" entry in the Help menu. For a more flexible way to run commands in new terminals, see :doc:`settings/launcher`.

.. termy:action:: MountFile Readonly ServerId RemotePath

   Initiates a task to perform a FUSE mount of the file or directory named by the absolute path :termy:param:`RemotePath` on the :ref:`specified server <server-lookup>`, which must not be a :term:`local server`. If :termy:param:`RemotePath` is empty, the selected file in the :doc:`Files tool <tools/files>` is used.

   If :termy:param:`Readonly` is ``1`` and :termy:param:`RemotePath` refers to a file, the mount will be made read-only. If :termy:param:`RemotePath` refers to a directory, the mount will always be made read-only regardless of :termy:param:`Readonly`.

   The user account under which :program:`qtermy` is running must have permission to perform unprivileged FUSE mounts using :manpage:`fusermount3(1)`, which may require adding the user to a "fuse" group. Refer to the documentation for your distribution's FUSE package.

   A temporary mountpoint folder will be created in the application's runtime directory. After the mount has been made, the task's output file will be set so that the mounted path can be opened from the :doc:`Tasks tool <tools/tasks>` or via :termy:action:`OpenTaskFile`, :termy:action:`OpenTaskDirectory`, and similar actions. The configured :termy:global:`automatic action<Tasks/MountAction>` for mount tasks in the :doc:`Global settings <settings/global>` will be launched, if any.

   The task will keep running until a :termy:action:`cancel <CancelTask>`, :termy:launcher:`timeout <Launcher/UnmountIdleTime>`, or server connection loss. If the status of the task is "Idle" or "In Use", the mount is set up and ready to use. To unmount, ensure all applications and terminals referencing mounted files have been closed, then cancel the task using the :doc:`Tasks tool <tools/tasks>` or :termy:action:`CancelTask` action.

   For read-write mounts, local applications such as text editors may create temporary files (but not directories) within the mountpoint folder. These will be written to underlying local storage. File rename operations to and from the mounted remote file are supported. Some applications may perform file operations that aren't supported by :program:`qtermy`'s FUSE filesystem implementation. Test each application for compatibility with :program:`qtermy` FUSE mounts before using this feature to edit files in production.

   .. warning:: If :program:`qtermy` is forcibly closed by a KILL signal, the FUSE mount will not be properly unmounted and may need to be cleaned up manually using :manpage:`umount(8)` and :manpage:`fusermount3(1)`. Furthermore, a read-write mount which is interrupted for any reason may cause data loss in the remote file. Use the remote file mount feature with caution.

.. termy:action:: NewConnection ConnType ConnArg ServerId

   Initiates a task to create an anonymous :doc:`connection <settings/connection>` of type :termy:param:`ConnType`. If :termy:param:`ServerId` is empty, the connection is run as a child process of :program:`qtermy` itself. Otherwise, it is run from the specified server.

   If :termy:param:`ConnArg` is empty, a :doc:`dialog box <dialogs/connect-dialogs>` will be shown to collect the configuration for the connection. Otherwise, :termy:param:`ConnArg` contains the connection configuration specific to :termy:param:`ConnType`.

   :termy:param:`ConnType` must be one of the following:

     * ``3``: A :ref:`generic connection <connect-custom>` launched via an arbitrary command. :termy:param:`ConnArg` must be empty; the dialog box will always be shown.

If :termy:param:`Icon` is empty, the icon will revert to the string specified by the ``icon`` server :term:`attribute`. Otherwise, an SVG file with the given name is loaded from :file:`{$HOME}/.local/share/qtermy/images/server` or :file:`{prefix}/share/qtermy/images/server` in that order. If no such file is found, the name "default" is used instead. The name "none" specifies an empty icon.

   A custom icon can be set on a server automatically using the :termy:server:`FixedThumbnailIcon <Appearance/FixedThumbnailIcon>` server setting.

.. termy:action:: SetTerminalIcon Icon TerminalId

   Sets the thumbnail icon for the :ref:`specified terminal <terminal-lookup>` in the :doc:`Terminals tool <tools/terminals>` to :termy:param:`Icon`.

     * The terminal's :termy:profile:`palette <Appearance/Palette>`, :termy:profile:`font <Appearance/Font>`, :termy:profile:`layout <Appearance/WidgetLayout>`, :termy:profile:`fills <Appearance/ColumnFills>`, and :termy:profile:`badge <Appearance/Badge>` (including any per-terminal adjustments) will be pushed to the server as terminal :term:`attributes <attribute>`. Other clients may honor these settings (in :program:`qtermy` this is controlled via :ref:`profile settings <profile-collaboration>`). Only the owning client is allowed to set these attributes.
     * The active viewport's scrollback position and :ref:`timing origin <timing-widget>` will be pushed to the server as terminal :term:`attributes <attribute>`. Other clients may honor this information (in :command:`qtermy`, this is controlled via the :termy:profile:`FollowRemoteScrolling <Collaboration/FollowRemoteScrolling>` profile setting and the :termy:action:`ToggleTerminalFollowing` action). Only the owning client is allowed to set these attributes.

   .. warning:: **Terminal ownership is not a security mechanism**. Any client connected to a server can take ownership of a terminal at any time.
