Getting Started
===============

The quickest way to get started with TermySequence is to install it via your distribution's package manager. Visit the `main page <https://termysequence.io>`_ to view the list of distributions for which TermySequence has been packaged. TermySequence consists of a multiplexing terminal emulator server, :doc:`termy-server <server>`, and a desktop application, :doc:`qtermy <client-qt>`. You'll need both server and client on your workstation. Only the server is necessary on network servers and in containers.

If :program:`termy-server` and/or :program:`qtermy` haven't been packaged for your distribution, you'll need to :doc:`build from source <build>`.

Once you have qtermy running, proceed to :doc:`first-steps`.
