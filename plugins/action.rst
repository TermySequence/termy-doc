Custom Action
=============

A Custom Action is a :doc:`plugin <index>` feature that acts as a new :doc:`action <../actions>` within :program:`qtermy`. It can be invoked with parameters just like an ordinary action, from any setting that specifies an action string. This includes :ref:`action bindings <keymap-action>` in a :doc:`keymap <../settings/keymap>`. Simply prepend the string "Custom" to the name of the custom action as passed to :js:func:`registerCustomAction` and join it together with any parameters separated by vertical bar (\|) characters.

Custom actions have access to a rich API that exposes much of :program:`qtermy`'s internal state. It's even possible to prompt the user for string values and to register timers and callback functions to be notified of :term:`attribute` changes. Custom actions can invoke other actions, including custom actions, although such invocations will not be made until after control has returned from the custom action.

The file :file:`action.mjs.example` distributed with :program:`qtermy` implements a variety of sample custom actions and is annotated with explanatory comments. The file :file:`rectcopy.mjs` is another custom action implementing rectangle copy of selected text.

The entry point to a custom action is the run function passed to :js:func:`plugin.registerCustomAction`, which is called once each time the action is invoked:

.. js:function:: run_function(manager[, arg1, arg2...])

   Invokes the custom action with the specified :ref:`manager handle <action-manager>`. The remaining arguments are the parameters specified in the action invocation, if any.

.. _action-handle:

Handle Interface
----------------

The custom action API is based primarily on typed *handles*, which are Javascript objects that provide interfaces to specific objects within :program:`qtermy` such as windows, terminals, :doc:`settings objects <../settings/index>`, etc. Handles have the following common methods across all object types:

.. js:function:: handle.isValid()

   Returns whether the handle is valid. Handles become invalid when their underlying object is deleted. A handle which has been saved across Javascript entry points must be checked using this method before using it.

.. js:function:: handle.setPrivateData(name, value)

   Attaches an arbitrary value to the handle with the given name. It can be retrieved using :js:func:`getPrivateData <handle.getPrivateData>` from any handle of the same type which references the same underlying object.

.. js:function:: handle.getPrivateData(name)

   Returns a value previously attached to the handle using :js:func:`setPrivateData <handle.setPrivateData>`, or ``undefined`` if no such value exists.

.. js:function:: handle.setInterval(callbackObj, timeout)

   Installs a notification callback to be called on a periodic interval. The callback will be called repeatedly until canceled.

   :param object callbackObj: See below
   :param integer timeout: A nonzero timeout interval expressed in tenths of a second.
   :returns: An object with a ``cancel`` method that will cancel the timer.

   The *callbackObj* must define its ``callback`` field to a method which takes a :ref:`handle <action-handle>` as its first argument. The object may also contain arbitrary private fields for the plugin's own use. For protection against future API changes, name private fields starting with an underscore (_) character. A return value other than ``true`` or ``undefined`` from the callback method will cancel the timer.

.. _action-manager:

Manager Interface
-----------------

A manager handle represents an application window. Since actions may need to display modal dialogs, all actions are invoked in the context of an application window.

.. js:function:: manager.invoke(actionName[, arg1, arg2...])

   Invokes the specified :doc:`action <../actions>` with the given parameters, if any. The actual invocation will be delayed until after control has returned from Javascript. Multiple action invocations will be run in the order they are made.

   If it's necessary to regain control after the action has been invoked, register a callback using :js:func:`setInterval <handle.setInterval>`.

.. js:function:: manager.notifySend(summary, body)

   Calls :termy:action:`NotifySend` with the given *summary* and *body*.

.. js:function:: manager.listServers()

   Returns a list of :ref:`server handles <action-server>` corresponding to all currently connected :doc:`servers <../settings/server>`.

.. js:function:: manager.createTerminal(server, profile[, termParams])

   Creates a new terminal on the given server, with the given profile, using the given parameters.

   :param handle server: A :ref:`server handle <action-server>`.
   :param handle profile: A :ref:`profile handle <action-settings>`.
   :param object termParams: See below
   :returns: A :ref:`terminal handle <action-terminal>` for the new terminal.

   If *termParams* is provided, its fields are used to override the settings in the given :doc:`profile <../settings/profile>`. All fields are optional.

      theme

      palette
         A palette object as described by :js:attr:`terminal.palette`. Unspecified indices (holes) will be filled with values from the compiled-in default palette. The terminal's :termy:profile:`Palette <Appearance/Palette>` and :termy:profile:`Dircolors <Files/Dircolors>` will be set from the result.

      layout
         See :js:attr:`terminal.layout`.

      fills

      environment
         A list of strings of the form ``+name=value`` to set an environment variable or ``-name`` to remove an environment variable. These will be applied on top of the profile's :termy:profile:`Environment <Emulator/Environment>` setting.

   index
      The pane's index number, as displayed in the viewport (with :termy:global:`ShowMainIndex <Appearance/ShowMainIndex>`) or terminal thumbnail (with :termy:global:`ShowThumbnailIndex <Appearance/ShowThumbnailIndex>`).

.. js:function:: manager.prompt(callbackObj, prompt[, initial])

   Prompts the user for a string value. Only one prompt can be displayed at a time.

   :param object callbackObj: See below

   :param string initial: An optional initial value for the input text field.
   :returns: ``true`` on success, ``false`` if the prompt cannot be displayed

   The *callbackObj* must define its ``callback`` field to a method which takes a :ref:`manager handle <action-manager>` as its first argument and the user-provided string as its second argument. This will be invoked if and when the user accepts the dialog. The object may also contain arbitrary private fields for the plugin's own use. For protection against future API changes, name private fields starting with an underscore (_) character.

.. js:function:: manager.copy(string)

   Copies the given string to the clipboard as UTF-8 text.

   :param object callbackObj: See below
   :param string name: The name of the attribute to monitor.
   :param integer timeout: An optional timeout expressed in tenths of a second. The monitor will be automatically canceled after the timeout has elapsed. If not specified, the monitor will remain active until explicitly canceled.
   :returns: An object with a ``cancel`` method that will cancel the attribute monitor.

   The *callbackObj* must define its ``callback`` field to a method which takes a :ref:`server handle <action-manager>` as its first argument, the new value of the attribute as its second argument, and the attribute name as its third argument. The object may also contain arbitrary private fields for the plugin's own use. For protection against future API changes, name private fields starting with an underscore (_) character. A return value other than ``true`` or ``undefined`` from the callback method will cancel the attribute monitor.

.. js:function:: cursor.moveToRow(row)

   Moves the cursor to the specified row, indexed from the top of the scrollback buffer. Returns a reference to the cursor.

.. js:function:: cursor.moveByOffset(delta)

.. js:function:: cursor.moveToOffset(offset)

   Moves the cursor to the specified string offset within its current row, measured in UTF-16 code points. Use this method when performing Javascript string computations. The new cursor location will be adjusted to the nearest logical character. Returns a reference to the cursor.
