.. _protocol-errors:

Error Codes
-----------

These appear in the :termy:protocol:`DISCONNECT` message, in a negative :ref:`handshake reply <protocol-handshake>`, and elsewhere.

 * 0: Normal exit (terminals only, the :termy:profile:`Command <Emulator/Command>` exited).
 * 1: Closed (terminals only, the terminal was explicitly :termy:protocol:`closed <CLOSE_TERM>`).
 * 2: The server process is shutting down on a signal.
 * 3: The forwarding process (forked and executed by the client) is shutting down on a signal.
 * 4: A server error occurred.
 * 5: A forwarding error occurred.
 * 6: The client and server do not agree on protocol major version.
 * 7: Protocol parse error.
 * 8: Duplicate connection. The client and server are already connected.
 * 9: The connection closed unexpectedly.
 * 10: The server has reached its connection limit.
 * 11: The connection timed out because a :termy:protocol:`keepalive <KEEPALIVE>` was not received.

In :termy:protocol:`REMOVE_SERVER`, :termy:protocol:`REMOVE_TERM`, and :termy:protocol:`REMOVE_CONN` messages, the high order bit (32) can be set in the error code. This indicates that the disconnection occurred on an intermediate hop.
