Attributes
==========

An attribute is a UTF-8 key/value pair attached to a server, terminal, or region. These are tracked by the server and visible to all connected clients.  Attributes are used for many purposes within the :doc:`TermySequence protocol <../protocol>`.

Some server and terminal attributes are treated specially by the server.
