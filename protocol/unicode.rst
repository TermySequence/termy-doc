Character Encoding
==================

The character encoding specifies the widths and combining behavior of Unicode code points within a terminal. The encoding is used to synchronize the location of the screen cursor between the client and server.

See `unicode10tab.hpp <https://github.com/TermySequence/termysequence/blob/master/lib/unicode10tab.hpp>`_ for the character width tables and `unicode10impl.hpp <https://github.com/TermySequence/termysequence/blob/master/lib/unicode10impl.hpp>`_ for the parsing code used by the current implementation.
