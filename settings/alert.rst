Alert
=====

Alert settings are named settings objects stored at :file:`{$HOME}/.config/qtermy/alerts`. Alerts can be created and edited from the :doc:`Manage Alerts window <../dialogs/manage-alerts>`. The files can also be edited directly in a text editor, but note that :program:`qtermy` does not monitor for external changes to settings files. Use the reload files button in the :doc:`Manage Alerts window <../dialogs/manage-alerts>` to load external changes and new files without restarting the application.

An *alert* is a description of a terminal condition, together with the action that should be taken when the condition becomes true. An alert can be made active in a terminal from the Terminal menu, various context menus, or by using the :termy:action:`SetAlert` action. Only one alert can be active in a terminal at any given time.

When the condition described by the action becomes true in the terminal, the action will trigger and the action described by the alert will be taken. The alert will then be made inactive and will not trigger again in that terminal. An alert can also be made inactive from the Terminal menu, various context menus, or by using the :termy:action:`ClearAlert` action.

Alerts can be favorited in the :doc:`Manage Alerts window <../dialogs/manage-alerts>`, which will cause them to appear at the top of alert selection menus.

Condition
---------

.. termy:alert:: Condition/Type enumeration

   The type of condition that the alert will monitor for. The choices are as follows:

     * *Activity in terminal*: Any activity is reported by the terminal. This includes printable output as well as non-printing output such as control characters, bells, or region updates.
     * *Inactivity in terminal*: No activity occurs in the terminal for the duration of time specified by :termy:alert:`InactivityTime <Condition/InactivityTime>`.
     * *Command finishes in terminal*: A job finishes in the terminal with any exit status. This requires :doc:`shell integration <../shell-integration>`.
     * *Command succeeds in terminal*: A job finishes in the terminal with an exit status of zero. This requires :doc:`shell integration <../shell-integration>`.
     * *Command fails in terminal*: A job finishes in the terminal with a nonzero exit status. This requires :doc:`shell integration <../shell-integration>`.
     * *String seen in terminal*: The literal string specified by :termy:alert:`SearchString <Condition/SearchString>` is printed to the terminal. This must occur after the alert is made active (scrollback is not searched).
     * *Regex seen in terminal*: Any string matching the ECMAScript regular expression specified by by :termy:alert:`SearchString <Condition/SearchString>` is printed to the terminal. This must occur after the alert is made active (scrollback is not searched).
     * *Bell seen in terminal*: A bell character (BEL, Ctrl+G) is printed to the terminal.
     * *Attribute is string*: The terminal :term:`attribute` named by :termy:alert:`AttributeName <Condition/AttributeName>` becomes equal to the literal string specified by :termy:alert:`SearchString <Condition/SearchString>`. If this condition is true when the alert is :termy:action:`set <SetAlert>`, the alert will trigger immediately.
     * *Attribute is regex*: The terminal :term:`attribute` named by :termy:alert:`AttributeName <Condition/AttributeName>` matches the ECMAScript regular expression specified by :termy:alert:`SearchString <Condition/SearchString>`. If this condition is true when the alert is :termy:action:`set <SetAlert>`, the alert will trigger immediately.

.. termy:alert:: Condition/InactivityTime integer

   The time that the terminal must remain idle before the alert triggers, if the condition :termy:alert:`Type <Condition/Type>` is set to monitor for inactivity.

.. termy:alert:: Condition/SearchString string

   The search string or regular expression to match. Several condition types make use of this setting. See :termy:alert:`Type <Condition/Type>`.

.. termy:alert:: Condition/AttributeName string

   The terminal :term:`attribute` name to monitor, if the condition :termy:alert:`Type <Condition/Type>` is set to monitor for changes to an attribute.
