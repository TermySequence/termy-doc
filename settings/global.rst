Global
======

The global settings object is a singleton stored at :file:`{$HOME}/.config/qtermy/qtermy.conf`. Global settings can be edited from the View menu or by calling the :termy:action:`EditGlobalSettings` action. The file can also be edited directly in a text editor, but note that :program:`qtermy` does not monitor for external changes to settings files.

   :local:

General
-------

.. termy:global:: Global/LogThreshold enumeration

   Specifies which severity level of log message will automatically show the :doc:`../dialogs/event-log`.

.. termy:global:: Global/LogToSystem boolean

   If enabled, log messages will be sent to the default Qt logging handler in addition to the :doc:`../dialogs/event-log`.

.. termy:global:: Global/RestoreGeometry boolean

   If enabled, the information described in :termy:global:`SaveGeometry <Global/SaveGeometry>` is restored when an application window is opened to the value it had when the window was last closed with :termy:global:`SaveGeometry <Global/SaveGeometry>` enabled or the :termy:global:`SaveGeometryNow <Global/SaveGeometryNow>` button was pressed.

.. termy:global:: Global/SaveGeometry boolean

   If enabled, the following information is saved when an application window is closed. It will be restored when the same number of windows are reopened if :termy:global:`RestoreGeometry <Global/RestoreGeometry>` is enabled. The saved information is stored in the :doc:`State settings <state>` in an opaque format.

     * The size and position of the window and dockable widgets within it.
     * The layout of split view panes within the window.
     * For each pane, the ID and profile name of the terminal within the pane.
     * For each pane, the scrollback position, :ref:`Timing widget <timing-widget>` origin, and :term:`selected job` of each viewport that has been created in that pane.

   When restoring the saved settings, the application will try to match viewports and terminals as closely as possible. For example, if the saved terminal for a pane cannot be found by its ID, but an unassigned terminal with the same profile name exists, it will be substituted.

.. termy:global:: Global/SaveGeometryNow none

   A button that causes the information described in :termy:global:`SaveGeometry <Global/SaveGeometry>` to be saved immediately for all application windows.

.. termy:global:: Global/RestoreOrder boolean

   If enabled, the ordering and shown/hidden status of terminals within the :doc:`Terminals tool <../tools/terminals>` will be restored to the values they had when the window was last closed with :termy:global:`SaveOrder <Global/SaveOrder>` enabled or the :termy:global:`SaveOrderNow <Global/SaveOrderNow>` button was pressed.

.. termy:global:: Global/SaveOrder boolean

   If enabled, the ordering and shown/hidden status of terminals within the :doc:`Terminals tool <../tools/terminals>` is saved when an application window is closed. It will be restored when the same number of windows are reopened if :termy:global:`RestoreOrder <Global/RestoreOrder>` is enabled. The saved information is stored in the :doc:`State settings <state>` in an opaque format.

.. termy:global:: Global/SaveOrderNow none

   A button that causes the information described in :termy:global:`SaveOrder <Global/SaveOrder>` to be saved immediately for all application windows.

.. termy:global:: Global/ProfileMenuSize integer

   The number of items to show in dynamic item chooser menus such as the Switch Profile menu, in which :doc:`settings objects <../settings/index>` or icons are displayed for the user to select from.

.. termy:global:: Global/DocumentationRoot string

   The root URL used by the application to access :doc:`this documentation <../index>`. Setting an empty string and restarting the application will restore the default value.

   .. tip:: Save a `copy <https://termysequence.io/releases/>`_ of this documentation to your hard drive, then set this setting to its ``file://`` URL to get instant page loads and offline availability.

   .. note:: This setting requires an application restart to take effect.

.. termy:global:: Global/IconTheme string

   The name of an icon theme directory located under :file:`{prefix}/share/qtermy/icons`, or ``none`` to disable icons. Icons are shown within menu entries and in windows and dialog boxes. This setting does not affect images loaded from :file:`{prefix}/share/qtermy/images` which are shown in terminal thumbnails.

   .. note:: This setting requires an application restart to take effect.

Server
------

.. termy:global:: Server/LaunchTransient boolean

   If enabled, a :term:`transient local server` is launched by the application on startup.

.. termy:global:: Server/LaunchPersistent boolean

   If enabled, a connection to the :term:`persistent user server` is made by the application on startup, launching it if it's not already running.

.. termy:global:: Server/PreferTransient boolean

   If enabled, the :term:`transient local server` is preferred over the :term:`persistent user server` for creating new local terminals and running local tasks. Note that if only one of the two servers is connected, it will be used as the :term:`local server` regardless of the value of this setting.

.. termy:global:: Server/CloseConnectionsWindowOnLaunch boolean

   If enabled, the :doc:`Manage Connections window <../dialogs/manage-connections>` will close when a :doc:`connection <../settings/connection>` is launched from within it.

.. termy:global:: Server/AutoQuit boolean

   If enabled, the application will exit when the last terminal is closed.

.. termy:global:: Server/PopulateTime integer

   The number of milliseconds that the application should wait after a server connection has been made for all of the server's existing terminals to be reported. At connection time, the server reports how many terminals it has, followed the by information for each terminal. The information on existing terminals is used in the :termy:global:`Global/RestoreGeometry` logic to restore the previous appearance of the application. Normally the terminal information arrives immediately, but a very slow connection might cause it to arrive late. A race condition also exists where a terminal might be closed between the time that the server reports the number of existing terminals and the time that the server sends the terminal information. This setting puts a limit on the amount of time the application will wait for the information to arrive.

.. termy:global:: Server/ScrollbackFetchSpeed enumeration

   Controls how quickly the application downloads scrollback contents in the background. Enable the :termy:profile:`ShowFetchPosition <Appearance/ShowFetchPosition>` profile setting to view the progress of scrollback downloads in the :ref:`Minimap widget <minimap-widget>`.
